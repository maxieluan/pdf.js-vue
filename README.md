I have gone through all the possible sources. Basically all materials about pdfjs is using version 2.x.

I am testing projects using 3.5, the current stable version.

The demo will be used with vue.

This project is expected to be updated continuously.

- [x] make it work with vue
- [x] render in canvas
- [x] paging
- [x] text vue
- [x] dynamic layout
- [] custom tool bar
- [] not load worker from url
- [] annotation.
